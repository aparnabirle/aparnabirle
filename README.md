Hi, I’m Aparna Birle.

I’m a Finance Data Analyst working at the intersection of FP&A, MIS reporting, and business intelligence. I build SQL-driven data models and Power BI dashboards that help leadership teams track revenue, margins, burn rate, and cash runway.

I currently work as a Financial Data Analyst at FynTrust, delivering monthly management reports and automated dashboards for startups and SMEs. My work focuses on reducing manual reporting effort, improving KPI clarity, and enabling data-backed decisions.

My background includes CA articleship, equity research, and financial analysis, which gives me a strong foundation in financial statements, data accuracy, and business context. I use that foundation to design analytics solutions that are practical, reliable, and used in real workflows.

On this GitHub, you’ll find end-to-end finance analytics projects built using:
SQL Server for data extraction, validation, and transformation
Power BI and DAX for KPI-driven dashboards
Excel for analysis and reporting
Python pandas for data cleaning and analysis

These projects simulate real FP&A and MIS use cases rather than tutorial-style exercises.
